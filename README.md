# wireguard_api
This repo contains the code for a Python3 based web API service that allows for the brokering of connections between wireguard servers and their clients.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an automated way of brokering connections between Wireguard clients and their servers.

Note:
* All testing for this project has been done on Ubuntu 20.04, within a python3.8 venv connecting to the docker image postgres:12.3.

## Design Descisions
### Pull From Server
Updates to a WireGuard servers client list will be done via a pull from the server. This is because the intention of this API is for it to be used in conjuction with the wg-tools package, specifically the `wg syncconf` command, to avoid disrupting existing client connections when adding a new client. As the documentation for this command says it is "much less efficient" I have assumed it would be best to do this on a time interval basis, e.g. every 30 seconds, to avoid refreshing the client list for every new client addition/deletion.

### Clients
A client should be thought of as a single hostname, that has one or multiple peerings.

Client assumptions:
* A client can be peered to multiple servers but can only have one concurrent peering to any single server.
* If a client is deleted by name all instances of peering are also deleted.
* A client must have a peering instance to exist.
* A client will be directly requesting the API for changes to itself.

### Security
Currently the project requires a specified shared username/password for all POST requests and assumes it is behind a TLS proxy.

## Local Test Setup
API Brokering Service:
* Create your database e.g. `docker run -it -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme123 -p 5432:5432 postgres:12.3`
* Build a local docker image of the web api: `docker build -t test .`
* Create the missing files listed within docker-compose.yml. See https://gist.github.com/fntlnz/cf14feb5a46b2eda428e000157447309 for a guide on making ssl certs.
* Create a docker swarm `docker swarm init`
* Deploy docker services using the docker-compose.yml file `docker stack deploy test -c docker-compose.yml`
